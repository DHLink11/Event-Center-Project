                    <h3>Monster Manuel</h3>
                    <p>In this event, we play the age old game of monster vs monster. We will have contestants pick monsters totaling the same challenge rating and then have them compete in an gladitorial matches until one side reigns triumphant. The first event will feature challenge ratings 1-5, and the last event of the day will feature challenge ratings 20+. Come and see how many rats it takes to slay a gorgon. As contestants decide the actions of their creature(s) and roll dice to determine their fate. Our staff will be commentating and explaining the various features and abilites of each side's monster(s) for those unfamiliar.</p>

                    <h3>God of a new world</h3>
                    <p>We've dealt with the monsters and the characters, now we move onto the dungeon masters. The heart and soul to every good campaign is the dungeon master, for they are the one who creates the world that the players interact with and weave the stories that keep players coming back every session filled with joy and excitement. But every dungeon master must start with their dreaded first campaign, we're here to offer guidance in both running the game, worldbuilding, and storywriting.</p>
